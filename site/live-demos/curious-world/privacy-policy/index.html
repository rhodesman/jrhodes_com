            <h2 class="privacy-sub">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome! You have arrived at the Curious World website (“Site”) which is owned and/or operated by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company (collectively, "HMH," "we," "our" or "us").  This "Privacy Policy" governs your use of the Site.</p>
            <p>The Site is a social sharing website that enables parents to memorialize and share developmental milestones regarding their young children.  It provides the opportunity to post and share photos and exchange comments in an online, public setting.  The Site is primarily directed to parents.  However, to the extent parts of the Site offer pages for children to use at the direction of their parents, we will comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) for those pages. </p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the Curious World Mobile App or other HMH websites or services.  Nor does it apply to data we receive from third parties unless we combine such data with Personal Information (defined below) that we have ourselves collected under this Privacy Policy.  Except for any portion of the Site to which COPPA applies, our statements under this Privacy Policy only cover information collected by us directly, and not by third parties that may interact with our Site</p>
