              <h1><span>Terms of Use</span></h1>
            <p>   <b>Overview; Your Consent.</b>  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company ("<b>HMH</b>" "<b>we</b>" or "<b>us</b>") has developed a website designed to allow parents to document and share their children's progress, and to help their children become "school ready" (the "<b>Curious World Website</b>" or the "<b>Site</b>").  These Terms and Conditions of Use (the "<b>Terms</b>") govern use of our Curious World Website, and apply to parents and other users of the Site (collectively, "<b>you</b>"). Please read these Terms carefully.  By using the Curious World Website, you agree to comply with these Terms</p>
            <p> <b>Your Participation.</b>  The Curious World Website allows you to participate in a range of activities, to create and store a range of content during these activities and, if you choose, to share this content with others.  Our Cardfolio feature, for example, allows you to upload and store photos and videos that you have created, and to track, organize, and store your content.  Moreover, if you choose, you can share your content via our "Community" pages and, while there, engage in discussions and other exchanges with members of our Curious World community</p>

            <p><b>You Own Your Content.</b> The content that you choose to upload and store on the Curious World Website -- whether through your Cardfolio, Community participation, or otherwise -- is referred to as "<b>your Content.</b>" You own your Content.</p>

            <p><b> Use Good Sharing Practices.</b>  Keep in mind that, if you post your Content to our Community pages, it will be accessible to members of the Curious World community and, depending on whether you mark your submission "private" (in the manner provided on our Community pages), accessible to the general public,.  Please use good online practices when posting this information, and do not disclose personal information about yourself or your child without consideration, and do not disclose personal information about others without their permission.  Please see our <a href="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy </a> for further details. </p>

            <p><b>Permissions With Respect to Your Content.</b>  Although you own your Content, when you share your Content through our Community pages, you are necessarily giving others the ability and permission to further share and use your Content, over our Site, through social media channels, and other communications channels.  In this regard, please keep in mind that you are responsible for ensuring (a) that you have sufficient rights to your Content for uses in connection with our Site and these onward transfers, and (b) that your Content complies with our Code of Conduct.  </p>

            <p><b>Our Treatment of Your Content.</b>  When you upload your Content to our Curious World Website, you give us permission to store and display your Content through the Site services you have chosen.  When you post Content that you have designated as "private" in accordance with our website's features, we will not redisplay this Content in a manner that changes the "private" setting without your permission.  Please retain copies of your Content.  Although we may backup your Content as part of our normal processes (or otherwise), you acknowledge that, in our discretion, we are entitled to remove your Content from our active or backup servers without notice to you. </p>

            <p><b> Our License to You.</b>  Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the Curious World Website in accordance with its available features and documentation.  Except for your Content, and Content of other users (collectively, "<b>User-Generated Content</b>"), HMH and its licensors own all content and technology available through, or embodied within the Curious World Website, including all associated intellectual property rights ("<b>HMH Content</b>").  HMH Content includes templates, formatting, information, software, artwork, text, video, audio, pictures, trademarks, trade dress, activities, and other components of the Curious World Website.  Your license to use the Curious World Website is strictly limited; for example, you are not permitted to copy, republish, modify, reverse engineer, or seek to repurpose the Website or other HMH Content in any way.  We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in this Section 7 (Our License to You). </p>

            <p><b>Code of Conduct.</b>  Under our Code of Conduct, you agree that you will not:
             <ul>
               <li>Upload, store, or disseminate materials that impact or invade the privacy of others, such as photographs, video clips, sound recordings, personally identifiable information, or other materials that reveal personal, private or sensitive information about another person, without that person's consent; </li>
               <li>Disseminate material that is defamatory, unlawfully harassing, intentionally false, pornographic, violent or otherwise inappropriate; </li>
               <li>Infringe any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right; </li>
               <li>Transmit materials that contain viruses or other computer-programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, intercept, or expropriate any system, data, or personal information; </li>
               <li>Use the Site to artificially generate traffic or page links to a website or for any other purpose not expressly allowed under these Terms.</li>
               <li>Use the Site in a manner that could disable, overburden, or impair the Site or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the Site</li>
               <li>Seek to obtain access to any materials or information through "hacking," "data harvesting," or through other means we have not intentionally made available to you through the Site;  </li>
               <li>State or suggest, directly or indirectly, that HMH endorses User Generated Content; </li>
               <li>Use the Website for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms.  For example, you will not use the Website to violate any law, statute, or regulation (including, without limitation, those governing consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, or false advertising).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Compliance with Code of Conduct.</b>  We will enforce the above Code of Conduct where we deem necessary and reserve the right (but do not assume any obligation) to monitor your use of the Curious World Website for this purpose.  In addition to such monitoring, we may employ filters designed to detect and block the transmission of User Generate Content or other information that we believe, in our discretion, contains inappropriate language, images, or other elements.  We reserve the right at any time to remove your Content from some or all portions of the Site, and to terminate or suspend your access to some or all of the features of the Curious World Website if you engage in activities that we conclude, in our discretion, breach our Code of Conduct.  Due to our use of monitoring, filtering, and other methods for enforcing our Code of Conduct, your activities on our Curious World Website will not remain "private" or otherwise free of our review; be assured, however, that any monitoring or other actions we take with respect to our Code of Conduct will comply fully with our Privacy Policy.  </p>

            <p><b>Objectionable Conduct.</b>  Although we will monitor our Curious World Website as set out in Section 9 (Compliance with Code of Conduct), we do not guarantee, or provide any assurance that users will comply with our Code of Conduct.  Accordingly, you may be exposed to user language, content, or other information you find objectionable or offensive.  You agree that we are not obligated to respond to, or address your objections in any manner other than the manner expressly set out in these Terms.</p>

            <p><b>Allegations of Copyright Infringement.</b>  HMH respects the intellectual property rights of others and requires that its users do the same.  If you believe that content on the Curious World Website constitutes infringement of a work protected by copyright, please notify our agent, designated under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. ยง512) (the "DMCA") to respond to such concerns, as follows:

            <p><b>A Facilitator But Not A Participant.</b>  You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users, both online or offline.  Although we reserve the right, in our discretion, to monitor and seek to facilitate a resolution of a dispute between you and other users, apart from our duties under the DMCA and other applicable statutes (if any), we have no obligation to become involved in any way in disputes between you and others arising from our Website.   We provide our Code of Conduct in large part to define "good citizenship" on our Site, and minimize misunderstandings among our members.  </p>
            <p><b>Your Satisfaction; Non-Refundable Purchases.</b> We welcome you to our Site, and you have the opportunity to participate in a range of Site features without obligation or payment to us.  Take your time, and participate to the full extent you desire, at no cost.  We offer Curiosity Kits and, where applicable, other fee-for-feature portions of our Site (collectively, "<b>Payment-Required Features</b>"). If you are satisfied with the no-cost portions of our site, we welcome you to our Payment-Required Features, and believe you will enjoy them.  Please understand, though, that if you decide not to enjoy some or all of a Payment-Required Feature that you have purchased, we will not refund any portion of the purchase price, unless we determine, in our sole judgment, that unusual circumstances require a refund.</p>
            <p><b>Warranty Disclaimer.</b> THE CURIOUS WORLD WEBSITE IS PROVIDED BY HMH AND ITS LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. HMH, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, HEREBY DISCLAIMS (i) ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (ii) ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, CONTENT, COMPLETENESS, OR LEGALITY OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE CURIOUS WORLD WEBSITE OR IN HMH CONTENT; AND (iii) ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR THE DELETION OR ALTERATION OF USER GENERATED CONTENT OR HARM RESULTING FROM DOWNLOADING OR ACCESSING INFORMATION ON THE CURIOUS WORLD WEBSITE, INCLUDING HARM CAUSED BY VIRUSES OR SIMILAR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE CURIOUS WORLD WEBSITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>
            <p><b>Limitation Of Liability.</b> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR NEGLIGENCE, WILL HMH BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) THAT ARISE OUT OF OR ARE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE CURIOUS WORLD WEBSITE, OR THE HMH CONTENT. You agree that injunctive relief shall provide you with a good and sufficient remedy for any complaints against HMH arising out of its Curious World Website, and agree that you will not subsequently claim that such remedy or the remedy and damages limitations provisions of these Terms have "failed of their essential purpose."</p>
            <p><b>Local Consumer Law.</b> The laws of your jurisdiction may limit the effect of the warranty disclaimer and limits of liability set out in Sections 14 and 15. Please refer to the laws of your jurisdiction.</p>
            <p><b>Indemnity.</b> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold HMH, its licensors and service providers, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and employees harmless from any liability to third parties, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from or related to your breach of these Terms.</p>
            <p><b>Duration Of Rights; Termination.</b> The license we grant to you under these Terms will continue until the earlier of (a) your cessation of use of the Website, (b) our cessation of support for, or offering of the Website, or (c) your failure to comply with these Terms.  If you fail to comply with these Terms, the termination of your license is without prejudice to other rights and remedies HMH may hold. </p>
            <p><b>Privacy and the Curious World Website.</b> We value your privacy and the privacy of all our users. Please review our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use, and protect your personally identifiable information.  To the extent these Terms conflict with the terms of our Privacy Policy, the terms of our Privacy Policy will control</p>
            <p><b>General.</b> These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to its conflicts of law provisions. Both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in the judicial district where HMH resides.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.  HMH's failure to act with respect to non-compliance by a user does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar non-compliance.  These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter of these Terms and supersede any prior or contemporaneous understanding, whether written or oral.</p>
