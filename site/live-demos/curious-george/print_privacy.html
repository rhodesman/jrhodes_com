		<ol type="a">
			<li id="sec1a"><b>Information You Provide to Us</b> <p><b>Personal Information and Demographic Information.</b> On the Site(s), we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, email address, username and password ("<b>Personal Information</b>"); and (2) demographic information, such as your zip code ("<b>Demographic Information</b>"). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Site(s), including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Site(s). If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site(s), we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
			<li id="sec1b"><b>Information We Collect or Store As You Access and Use the Site(s)</b> <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site(s), we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site(s) ("<b>Usage Information</b>"). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone (a "<b>Device</b>") whenever you visit or interact with our Site(s). Usage Information may be non identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p> <p>This Usage Information may include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>your IP address or other unique identifier ("<b>Device Identifier</b>"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Site(s), and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</li>
					<li>your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</li>
					<li>the URL that referred you to our Site(s);</li>
					<li>the areas within our Site(s) that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;</li>
					<li>your Device location;</li>
					<li>your Device characteristics; and</li>
					<li>certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We may use various developed methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information ("<b>Tracking Technologies</b>"). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies, include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
				<p><i><b>Cookies</b></i>. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site(s). A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">www.adobe.com</a>. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Site(s) may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site(s) your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>
				<p><i><b>Web Beacons</b></i>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our Site(s)' pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site(s), to monitor how users navigate the Site(s), to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. </p>
				<p><i><b>Embedded Scripts</b></i>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site(s), such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site(s), and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
				<p><i><b>ETag, or entity tag</b></i>. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>
				<p>We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
				<p><i><b>Strictly Necessary</b></i>. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Site(s), including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.</p>
				<p><i><b>Performance Related</b></i>. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site(s), including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Site(s).</p>
				<p><i><b>Functionality Related</b></i>. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Site(s), including identifying you when you sign in to our Site(s) or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our Site(s).</p>
				<p><i><b>Targeting Related</b></i>. We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Site(s) based on how you interact with our content. This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the content that have been delivered to you.</p>
				<p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site(s). Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with our Site(s). We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Site(s) and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties. </p>
