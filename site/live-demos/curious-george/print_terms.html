<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Curious George web site available at <a href="http://www.curiousgeorge.com/">www.curiousgeorge.com</a> (the "<b>Site</b>"), which is for use by parents and teachers of preschoolers. The Site is provided by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company (collectively, "<b>HMH</b>," "<b>we</b>," "<b>our</b>" or "<b>us</b>"). These Terms govern your use of the Site (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions), regardless of how you access or use it, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise. By "<b>Site</b>", we mean any Internet domain address where these Terms are posted, and all features, widgets, applications, content, and downloads that are operated by us and that are available through or interact with it, and/or post links to these Terms.

<h2>If You Want to Use This Site,</h2>
<p>then carefully read these Terms, as they constitute a written agreement between you and HMH and they affect your legal rights and obligations.

				</ol>
			</li>
			<li id="sec2b"><b>Community Usage Rules</b>. As a user of the Site, these Community Usage Rules ("<b>Rules</b>") are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Site's online communities ("<b>Communities</b>").
				<ol type="i">
					<li><b>Nature of Rules</b>. Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Your User-Generated Content</b>. All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms. Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties. Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet. If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to HMH. (For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to HMH as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend's and the photographer's permission to do so.)</li>
							<li><b>Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family</b>. If you choose to submit photos to the Site, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know &mdash; and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</li>
							<li><b>Act Appropriately</b>. All of your Site activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others' opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy. If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on the Site. Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap. Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit. </li>
							<li><b>Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes</b>. Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.</li>
							<li><b>Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes</b>. Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity. </li>
							<li><b>Be</b> <b>Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content</b>. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company. </li>
							<li><b>Others Can See</b>. We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members. However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Site within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, e-mail address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others. </li>
							<li><b>Don't Share Other Peoples' Personal Information</b>. Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another person's address, phone number, e-mail address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by HMH.</li>
							<li><b>Don't Damage the Site or Anyone's Computers or Other Devices</b>. Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Site or any computer or other Device.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you submit User-Generated Content that HMH reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion. However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law. We may require at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us. Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Site.</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Your Interactions With Other Users; Disputes</b>. You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Site, whether online or offline. We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (<i>e.g</i>., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

		<ol type="A">
			<li><b>First &mdash; Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes</b>. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site, the Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, "<b>Dispute</b>"), or to any of HMH's actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an "<b>Excluded Dispute</b>", which includes those actions set forth in Section 11(D)), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 11(A). Your notice to us must be sent to: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116, Attn: General Counsel. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, HMH and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or HMH to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and HMH, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable. </li>
			<li><b>Forums for Alternative Dispute Resolution</b>.
				<ol type="i">
					<li><b>Arbitration</b>.If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 11(A) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 11(B). If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 11(A) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and HMH consent, in a writing signed by you and an Officer or legal representative of HMH, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration. In such a case (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a "Dispute" for the remainder of this Section 11(B). </p> <p>Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("<b>AAA</b>"). If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if HMH elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. If you and HMH do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 11(B)(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 11(B) will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.</p> <p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a "demand for arbitration," then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("<b>JAMS</b>") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of HMH consent to in writing. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.</p> <p>You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p> <p>AAA: 800.778.7879 JAMS: 949.224.1810</p> <p>http://www.adr.org/ http://www.jamsadr.com/</p></li>
					<li><b>Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution</b>. In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the "metropolitan statistical area" (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require HMH to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 11 to be enforceable, then HMH will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act. </li>
				</ol>
			<li><b>Limited Time to File Claims</b>. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES &mdash; OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. </li>
			<li><b>Injunctive Relief</b>. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11 will not apply to any legal action taken by HMH to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or HMH's intellectual property rights (including such HMH may claim that may be in dispute), HMH's operations, and/or HMH's products or services. </li>
			<li><b>Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement</b>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 11(G).</li>
			<li><b>No Class Action Matters</b>. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 11(B)(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 11(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 11(G). </li>
			<li><b>Federal and State Courts in Suffolk County</b>. Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 11(B), and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Accordingly, you and HMH consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</li>
